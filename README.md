# Airbnb Final Project

## 1. Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data for New York City. The objective is to explore the data, gain insights, and apply data science techniques to understand patterns and trends within different boroughs of NYC.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to Airbnb listings, such as location, price, number of reviews, and availability.

## Dependencies
To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Structure of the Notebook
The notebook is divided into several sections:

### DPL (Data Preprocessing and Loading)
This section covers the initial steps of data loading and preprocessing. The data is cleaned and prepared for analysis.

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables. Key insights are drawn about the listings in various boroughs.

#### Insight: People in Brooklyn and Manhattan are not liking how the reviews are being taken
An observation made during the EDA about customer satisfaction in Brooklyn and Manhattan.

### Data Science
Data Science techniques are applied to predict certain outcomes and to understand the factors influencing these predictions.

#### Accuracy of Decision Tree Models
Decision Tree models are trained and evaluated for each borough:
- Brooklyn
- Manhattan
- Queens
- Bronx
- Staten Island

Each model's accuracy is reported and analyzed.

## Usage
To run the notebook:
1. Ensure you have all dependencies installed.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Results
The project provides insights into the Airbnb market in NYC, highlighting key differences and trends across different boroughs. It also demonstrates the application of machine learning models to predict outcomes based on the dataset.

## Conclusion
The notebook concludes with a summary of findings and potential areas for further analysis.
